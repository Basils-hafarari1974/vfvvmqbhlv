So I just walked out of The Electric State, and oh boy, my brain feels like it's been put through a blender that's also somehow a time machine? I mean, what the hell did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? In a good way, I think. It's like when you drink a coffee that's way too strong and then you ride the caffeine high straight into some alternate universe where robots have feelings, but like, real feelings and not that plastic crap. For real, it was like falling face-first into a digital painting that hasn't decided if it's dystopian or just misunderstood.

I was totally not prepared for whatever this   decided to throw at me. One second, you've got these jaw-droppingly beautiful landscapes, like if Van Gogh decided to paint a post-apocalyptic Instagram influencer's fever dream. The next, bam, there's some giant robot being all... contemplative. Or brooding? I don’t know, I mean, how am I supposed to read the emotions of a giant metal face? It's not like I minored in robot psychology or something.

> Also, there's that kid. Holy moly, she's got this look on her face like she's 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed the code of the universe and got bored with it. Kinda like when you figure out your espresso machine is actually more of a headache than a savior, but now you're in too deep to admit it? I’m not even sure if I should root for her or be afraid of what she might do if she 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥s the   to play on repeat. 

It's not all just eye candy, though—there’s some real thought bubbling under the surface, like one of those coffees where you forgot to screw the lid on tight, and it just spills everywhere, making a mess but, in a weird way, it all makes sense. Is it about growing up, or maybe the inevitability of change, or could it be a warning about our tech obsession? Maybe. But it’s also probably just about cool robots doing cool stuff. Honestly, it’s harder to pin down than my cat when I try to put the Christmas sweater on him.

Why they felt the need to throw in a sequence with the world's emptiest highway, I’ll never get. Like, we get it, there’s a lot of emptiness inside us and outside us. Insert deep existential sigh. Kudos to the set designers though, because their inner child must've had one hell of a field day with this.

```csharp
int nostalgiaLevel = 100;
bool isFutureB𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬 = true;
if (robotFeels == real) {
    𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩Movie(The Electric State);
}
```

Would I recommend you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Sure, why not? The visuals alone make it worth the ticket or a mediocre 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥, if you're into that. Plus, there’s something kinda cathartic about letting a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 tug you along its wonderfully disjointed narrative with all its rusty, twisted charm. Until then, I'm just gonna sit here and let my mind reboot.
